# hello-cpp

### "Hello, world!" for the modern developer.
The tradition "Hello, World!" programs date back to circa-1978 (give or take). This example program, hello-cpp, 
takes that traditional "Hello, world!" program concept and flips it onto it's head by showing off more syntax of a given 
programming language, in this specific-case C++.
